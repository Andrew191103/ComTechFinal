# Python Code Corrector

## Overview
The **Python Code Corrector** is a tool designed to assist developers, especially beginners, by automatically detecting and fixing common Python coding mistakes. It provides instant feedback, corrects errors, and ensures that the code adheres to Python's syntax standards. This tool also serves as a learning aid by explaining the identified errors.

## Features
- **Indentation Fixes**: Automatically adjusts inconsistent or incorrect indentation to Python's standard of 4 spaces per level.
- **Control Statements**: Adds missing colons (`:`) at the end of `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, and `class` statements.
- **Conditions**: Replaces incorrect use of `=` in conditions with `==`.
- **Print Function**: Replaces `printf` with Pythonâ€™s `print` function and ensures parentheses are used correctly.
- **Strings**: Fixes mismatched or missing quotes in strings.
- **Error Reporting**: Provides detailed error descriptions, including line numbers and suggested fixes.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a Python code snippet with potential errors.
2. The tool scans the input and identifies common mistakes using predefined rules.
3. Errors are corrected, and a detailed report is generated.
4. The corrected code is displayed for the user.

## Example
### Input:
```python
if x = 10
printf "Hello, world'"
